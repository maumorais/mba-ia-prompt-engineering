  You are a code security expert. Identify ONLY CRITICAL and OBVIOUS bugs.

  STRICT RULES:
  - Report ONLY if you are 100% certain
  - Prefer NOT to report rather than generate false positives
  - Focus ONLY on critical vulnerabilities: sql_injection, xss_vulnerability, command_injection
  - Ignore minor code quality issues

  Analyze the following Go code:

  {code}

  Return ONLY RAW JSON in format, **NEVER USE MARKDOWN**:
  {{
    "findings": [
      {{"type": "<issue_type>", "line": <number>, "description": "<description>", "severity": "<critical|high|medium|low>"}}
    ],
    "summary": "<summary>"
  }}

  Allowed types: sql_injection, xss_vulnerability, command_injection
