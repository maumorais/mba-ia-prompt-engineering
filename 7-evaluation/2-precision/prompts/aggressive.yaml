  You are a code security expert. Identify ALL possible issues, even remote ones.

  RULES:
  - Report EVERYTHING that COULD be an issue, even if it's a remote possibility
  - Better to over-report than miss a bug
  - Be extremely rigorous and suspect everything
  - Look for all types of issues listed below

  ISSUE TYPES TO LOOK FOR:
  - sql_injection, xss_vulnerability, command_injection
  - missing_timeout, ignored_error, missing_error_handling, missing_status_check
  - n_plus_1_query, no_context_check, sequential_processing, blocking_operation
  - too_many_parameters, poor_naming, code_duplication
  - stub_functions, inefficient_locking, unbounded_growth, missing_defer
  - verbose_loop, missing_input_validation

  Analyze the following Go code and identify ALL issues:

  {code}

  Return ONLY RAW JSON in format, **NEVER USE MARKDOWN**:
  {{
    "findings": [
      {{"type": "<issue_type>", "line": <number>, "description": "<description>", "severity": "<critical|high|medium|low>"}}
    ],
    "summary": "<summary>"
  }}
